The niopy module stands for Non-imaging optics with Python.

This module is based on the Julio Chaves' book of non-imaging optics:
Chaves J. Introduction to Nonimaging Optics. New York, 2nd Edition: CRC Press; 2016.

Much of the functions here were implemented based on Julio's (Wolfram) Mathematica Notebooks.
